Call center staffing optimization (Challenge Air Canada)


# Call center staffing optimization (Challenge Air Canada)

# Description of the challenge

In our unionized environment, staff bid for their schedules one year in advance (for example, they bid in September for schedules starting in January and will hold those schedules for one calendar year).

Given this, we would like to be able to more accurately predict when they will be needed and at what times of the day so we can stabilize our service levels.

Today, we attempt to do this through Excel using pivot tables and manual calculations. The use of an AI tool will is not currently being used or available to us.

Currently, we use an Excel spreadsheet to map staffing against our hours of operations and predicted call centre volumes.

We would like to leverage AI or a tool to help us predict needed staffing levels based off our historical which could in turn help optimize agent productivity and efficiency.

Ideally, this tool could be repeatedly used to allow us to optimize staffing and ensure that we are stagged sufficiently for growth and to meet our service levels.

# What you will accomplish

The aim of the challenge is to predict the number of calls and emails that will be received by the call center in the next 30 minutes.

#Criteria for judgement
We will score your submissions based on F-1 score. The score on the leadboard is the harmonic mean between the f1 score and the other metrics if applicable.

A presentation of the method used by the winners will be requested. The code must also be given.


# R^2 80.38 %	Score:	63.82 %
